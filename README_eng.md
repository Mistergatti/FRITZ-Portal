## 🚀 Installation in Home Assistant

### 1. Add the repository

1. In HA: **Settings → Apps → App Store**
2. Click **⋮ → Custom repositories** in the top right
3. Enter the URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/jayjojayson/FRITZ-Portal
   ```
4. Click **Add** → reload the page

### 2. Install the app

1. Search for **FRITZ!Portal** in the store and open it
2. Click **Install** (the build may take a few minutes)
3. Switch to **Configuration** and enter your credentials:

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `fritzbox_host` | Hostname or IP of the Fritz!Box | `fritz.box` |
| `fritzbox_user` | Fritz!Box username | – |
| `fritzbox_password` | Fritz!Box password | – |
| `ha_sensors` | Enable REST API fallback (only needed without MQTT broker) | `false` |
| `ha_sensors_interval` | System sensor interval (seconds) | `60` |
| `ha_sensors_traffic_interval` | Traffic sensor interval (seconds) | `300` |
| `ha_phone_sensors` | Enable telephony sensors: last call, last missed call and last incoming call (with number & name) as HA sensors – only useful if telephony runs through the FRITZ!Box | `false` |
| `keep_session_alive` | Keep the FRITZ!Box session permanently open – required for continuous HA sensor updates even when the portal is not actively opened. **Increases load on the FRITZ!Box and can compete with HA's built-in Fritz!SmartHome integration** – only enable when the sensors really must be updated 24/7. **Also required to switch WLAN from HA while the portal is not open.** | `false` |
| `traffic_history_server` | Continuously collect the download/upload history (last 30 min) on the server so the dashboard chart is fully filled immediately when you return – regardless of whether the portal was open. Costs slightly more FRITZ!Box load. Without this option the history is stored in the browser (localStorage) only. | `false` |
| `debug_logging` | Log all API requests (TR-064, data.lua) to the protocol – useful for troubleshooting, otherwise leave off | `false` |

4. **Save → Start**
5. Open via **Web UI** or directly at `http://<ha-ip>:3003`

> **Note:** The app automatically logs in to the Fritz!Box with the configured credentials on startup – no manual login required.

> **Fritz!Box Permissions:** The Fritz!Box user you configure needs the following permissions, otherwise individual sections of the app will not work. Configurable in the **FRITZ!Box UI → System → FRITZ!Box Users → [Edit user]**:
>
> | Permission | Required for |
> |---|---|
> | **FRITZ!Box settings** | Model/firmware, CPU/RAM/temperature, reboot, WLAN configuration (incl. guest access on/off), DHCP reservations, deleting devices from the host list, internet blocking |
> | **Voicemail, fax messages, FRITZ!App Fon and call list** | Call list on the telephony page |
> | **Smart Home** | SmartHome devices (sockets, thermostats, sensors, blinds) |
> | **VPN** | optional, only if the box is reachable via VPN |
>
> Additionally the option **"Allow access for applications"** must be enabled under **Home Network → Network → Network Settings** – otherwise TR-064 requests are rejected with `401 Invalid Action`.

> **MQTT Discovery:** FRITZ!Portal **always sends sensor data via MQTT** to Home Assistant automatically. All sensors are registered as a single **„FRITZ!Portal"** device in the HA device overview, where they can be individually renamed, categorised and used on dashboards.
>
> **No MQTT broker available?** Enable the **REST API fallback** in the app configuration (`ha_sensors: true`) or directly in the FRITZ!Portal GUI. Sensors will then appear as individual entities under *Settings → Entities*. To avoid duplicate entities, only one method should be active at a time.
>

## 📊 Using the dashboard features in Home Assistant

The FRITZ!Portal dashboard shows **6 live tiles** (model, CPU, RAM, temperature, hosts, IP pool) with
**sparklines** (small 60-point trend curves right inside the tile), the `TRAFFIC.LIVE` chart below them
and the sortable `HOSTS.ACTIVE` list (switchable **by activity / IP / name** via the `↑↓` button in the
top-right of the panel). This rich view lives inside the portal itself – via **Ingress** it is embedded
directly in the HA interface without any port forwarding.

### Embedding sparkline tiles & traffic into your own HA dashboards

The values behind the tiles are available as HA sensors (`sensor.fritzportal_cpu`, `…_ram`,
`…_temperature`, `…_online_devices`, `…_free_ips`, `…_download_speed`, `…_upload_speed`). Since they
carry a `state_class` (as of v1.4.4), they can be used directly in **statistics graphs** and in HA's
**mini-graph / sparkline cards**. Example for a trend tile like in the portal:

```yaml
# requires the HACS card "mini-graph-card"
type: custom:mini-graph-card
name: CPU
entities:
  - sensor.fritzportal_cpu
hours_to_show: 0.5      # 30 min, like the portal sparkline
points_per_hour: 120
line_width: 2
```

### Getting an IP list of active devices onto the HA dashboard

The full `HOSTS.ACTIVE` list (hostname · IP · LAN/WLAN, sortable) is a portal-internal view. Two ways to
surface it in HA:

1. **Embed the Ingress panel (recommended, shows the list 1:1 including sorting):** add an `iframe` card to
   an HA dashboard pointing at the FRITZ!Portal Ingress panel:
   ```yaml
   type: iframe
   url: /hassio_ingress/<YOUR-INGRESS-SLUG>   # take the URL from the opened FRITZ!Portal sidebar entry
   aspect_ratio: 75%
   ```
2. **Count + device list as a sensor:** `sensor.fritzportal_online_devices` provides the number of active
   devices as its **value** (statistics-capable, e.g. for a „devices online over the day" trend) and carries
   the full list of active devices – sorted by last activity – in the **`active_hosts` attribute** (each
   entry has `name`, `ip`, `type` = LAN/WLAN). No separate entity per device needed. Example table from the
   attribute (using the HACS card `flex-table-card`):
   ```yaml
   type: custom:flex-table-card
   title: Active devices
   entities:
     include: sensor.fritzportal_online_devices
   columns:
     - name: Name
       data: active_hosts
       modify: x.name
     - name: IP
       data: active_hosts
       modify: x.ip
     - name: Type
       data: active_hosts
       modify: x.type
   ```
   Or simply as a markdown list without an extra card:
   ```yaml
   type: markdown
   content: >
     {% for h in state_attr('sensor.fritzportal_online_devices','active_hosts') %}
     - **{{ h.name }}** · {{ h.ip }} · {{ h.type }}
     {% endfor %}
   ```

> For the 1:1 view incl. switchable sorting (activity/IP/name) the embedded Ingress view remains the direct
> route; the `active_hosts` attribute is the lightweight way to build your own card without Ingress.

### Switching WLAN from Home Assistant

Each WLAN/SSID (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, **guest access**) is registered as a controllable switch
`switch.fritzportal_wlan_<N>` inside the „FRITZ!Portal" device – provided an MQTT broker is set up. This
lets you toggle e.g. the guest network via button, automation or voice command. Without an MQTT broker the
state appears as a read-only sensor `sensor.fritzportal_wlan_<N>` (no switching possible).

> **Prerequisite:** switching requires an active FRITZ!Box session. When the portal is **not** currently
> open in a browser, the switch command is only executed if `keep_session_alive: true` is set. The
> FRITZ!Box user also needs write access to **„FRITZ!Box settings"**.

### Telephony sensors: recent calls in Home Assistant (v1.4.6+)

With the **"Telephony sensors"** option (System page or `ha_phone_sensors: true`) FRITZ!Portal pushes
three sensors to Home Assistant – via MQTT Discovery and/or the REST API fallback:

| Sensor | Content |
|---|---|
| `sensor.fritzportal_last_call` | Last call (incoming or outgoing) |
| `sensor.fritzportal_last_missed_call` | Last missed call |
| `sensor.fritzportal_last_incoming_call` | Last accepted incoming call |

The **sensor value** is the name of the remote party (from the FRITZ!Box phone book, fallback: phone
number). Details are available as **attributes**: `number`, `name`, `date`, `duration`, `type`, `device`,
`from`, `to`. Example of a small call card:

```yaml
type: markdown
title: Phone
content: >
  📞 **Last call:** {{ states('sensor.fritzportal_last_call') }}
  ({{ state_attr('sensor.fritzportal_last_call','number') }})
  – {{ state_attr('sensor.fritzportal_last_call','date') }}

  📵 **Missed:** {{ states('sensor.fritzportal_last_missed_call') }}
  ({{ state_attr('sensor.fritzportal_last_missed_call','number') }})
  – {{ state_attr('sensor.fritzportal_last_missed_call','date') }}
```

> The sensors are **disabled by default** since not everyone runs telephony through the FRITZ!Box.
> When disabled, the MQTT entities are automatically removed from HA again. The FRITZ!Box user needs the
> **"Voice messages, fax messages, FRITZ!App Fon and call list"** permission.
